     <p>Everyone wants to make money, but few people want
to take unknown or unnecessary risks. In today's market
environment, with standardized options, futures, and
convertible bonds in the mix, an understanding of
volatility and other market risks is absolutely essential.
This essay argues that risk and return are two sides of the
same investing coin-they can't be separated.</p>

     <p>There are a variety of <a name="risklist"></a>market risks. This list should cover most of the ones faced by
investors.</p>

<p><b><a name="co">Company-specific risk</a></b></p>

<p>This type of risk is the one people usually associate
with stocks, but bonds also have company-specific risk,
especially junk bonds. Actions taken (or not taken) by the
company or their competitors can impact earnings, market
share, quality of their products or services. The list is
almost endless! The best way to learn about
company-specific risks is to read analyst's reports and the
company's annual report, as well as the company's 10K, 10Q
and other filings with the SEC. Fortunately, these filings
are now done electronically-the database is called <a
href="http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">Edgar</a>. In
addition, there is now a Java <a
href="http://allan.stern.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/DayTicker2.pl">applet</a>
which helps to navigate the Edgar database, as well as
broadcasts a ticker tape of the latest filings. <a
href=#risklist">Back to the list</a>.</p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="ind">Industry risk</a></b></p>

<p>Companies in a particular industry obviously share some
of the same risks. For instance, companies which produce
specialty plastics are very sensitive to the normal
business cycle. Their stock prices often experience slumps
in earnings before and during recessions, and are among the
first industries to pick up toward the end of a recession.
Some companies have larger cash positions than others and
can usually handle the interest payments on their debit
without too much trouble. Other companies may have trouble
servicing their debit, so their bonds would not do as well
as others in the same industry group. And it is given that
their stock prices would depend on the business cycle. <a
href="#risklist">Back to the list</a>.
</p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="fraud">Risk of Fraud or Other
Deception</a></b></p>

<p>There have been examples of company officers or board
members who have acted to deceive the public. By this I
mean that someone or some group of individuals in the
company concealed information which should have been
disclosed to the investing public. This can even happen in
large companies-the recent case of <a href="#diawa">Diawa
Bank</a>'s New York branch is one example. In this case,
company officers in the United States and Japan knew that
an employee had admitted to recording false entries in his
bond trading accounts in order to conceal his losses. This
deception had occurred over a period of 12 years or so, and
when the employee no longer had control of settlement
(reconciling his trades in the bank's accounting system),
he confessed in a letter to senior management. But company
officers in the United States and Japan neglected to inform
the Federal Reserve Bank or the <a
href="http://www.sec.gov">Securities and Exchange
Commission</a> as they were required to do by US law.</p>

<br>

<p>Other examples are numerous, and usually involve small
companies. Please do <b>not</b> assume that large companies
cannot be hit by unscrupulious employees or senior
managers. In any case, the risk is small, since many people
will want to avoid the loss of their jobs and reputations
when they are caught. But recent votes in Congress reveal
that there is a strong movement among businesses, law
firms, and accounting firms to limit their liability in
cases of fraud. Law and accounting firms should be held
liable for their winking acceptance of fraudelent
information submitted to them by company office, which
happened during the 80's involving S&L's. Now, of course,
they and company officers would like to be shielded from
law and civil enforcement actions. This will ultimately be
very bad for investors, but who cares about a few little
people who can't afford to buy votes in Congress? Not the
legal "profession", whose members are supposed to be
officers of the court. Far too often the "lawyer-client
priviledge" is a convienent screen for all sorts of illegal
acts! If you don't believe this, just remember that even
the Mafia has lawyers and accountants.</p>

<p>Lest some termite out there flame me for my remarks in
the last paragraph, I should also add that there are plenty
of lawyers who will take your money and file suits against
companies whose stock price drops when the company releases
bad news. High-tech companies are right to object, and very
loudly, against these kinds of suits. They are no more than
fishing expeditions by lawyers who have been corrupted by
greed. <a href="#risklist">Back to the list</a>.</p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="rates">Interest Rate Risk</a></b></p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Bank tries to control the economy using two blunt instruments - the money supply and interest rates. They are inter-related, of course, and interest rates get more attention due to their effect on mortgages and commercial borrowing. The Fed's goal is price stability - the abscense or near-absence or inflation. So first let's understand inflation. The textbook definition is that inflation is a rise in the general price level.</p>

<p>It's very important to understand that price increases are themselves not inflationary. For instance, if unions strike to increase wages, the effect would be inflationary if the increases in pay were ultimately passed on to consumers. The ideal situation is for productivity (however it is measured) to increase fast enough that workers can demand higher wages without causing prices to skyrocket.</p>

<p>There is another contributor to inflation - the money supply. This is very carefully defined, and usually when people use the term "money supply", they mean M1. M1 is what the Fed calls cash or cash equivalents. These are very liquid assets such as checking accounts and certificates of deposits. Why is printing money inflationary? Well, there are more dollars sloshing around in the economy, and they are worth less. People will either spend or save this money, and when inflation is rising, people will usually spend it.</p>

<p>The problem with all this is that the Fed tries to look ahead. Assuming that inflation is going to rise, the Fed raises interest rates in an effort to cool the economy down without shutting off growth entirely. This is usually called a "soft landing" by the press. Unexpected changes in interest rates are known to be major market movers both for stocks and bonds. Yep, stocks can have interest rate risk - just think of utility companies that have heavy capital investments in power plants; they have a lot of bonds outstanding, and tend not to do well in a high interest rate environment.</p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="vol">Volatility</a></b></p>

<p>Market risk is the risk one takes by owning securities
that others may choose to buy or sell. Another name for
market risk is <b>volatility</b>. Many people try to reduce
this risk, but usually it can't be perfectly hedged (see
the discussion of <a href="#arb">Arbitrage and
Hedging</a>). It's also bad for your financial health, but
many claim these are "paper losses" and don't really
matter. On the other hand, I've yet to see a "paper gain"
that was disowned in this way (sic). Just take a look at
this table and tell me <a href="#down">downside risk</a>
(the risk that the return earned will fall short of
expectations) is not important:</p>

<p>The larger the drop, the higher the market has to climb to
erase the loss. Thus, the key to maximizing gains is to
maximize some measure of risk-adjusted return. The most
common measure of risk-adjusted return is the <b>Sharpe
ratio</b>, which was invented by Bill Sharpe (Nobel
laureate in Economics for his work on Modern Portfolio
Theory). It is</p>

<p>Sorry, the equation is not available yet!</p>

<p>The <i>risk-free</i> rate is usually taken to be the
current yield of one or three month Treasury bills. This
rate is <b>not</b> risk-free, but is a practical way of
measuring the hypothesized risk-free rate used in <a
href="#mpt">Modern Portfolio Theory</a>. Either returns
could be actual or expected. The <i>standard deviation</i>
is a statistical measure of the "spread" of the returns
about the mean. Usually, the standard deviation is
estimated from historical data, but sometimes sophisticated
statistical models are used. To calculate the standard
deviation, use the following formula:</p>

<p>Sorry, the equation is not available yet!</p>

<p>One curious artifact of the standard deviation is that
for many securities (including market indicies), it <i>goes
up</i> when the security return goes <i>down</i>, but not
necessarily the reverse!</p>

<p>Here is an example of calculating the Sharpe ratio of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, using the five years of
data between June 1991 and May 1996 (monthly data). The
standard deviation is calculated using the same five years
of historical data. <a href="#risklist">Back to the list</a>.

<p><b><a name="down">Downside Risk</a></b></p>

<p>This is the risk that the actual or realized return from
an investment is less than the expected or desired return. It
has received more attention in the 90's thanks to work by
Sartino, Miller, and others. The concept of downside risk is simple enough to understand, but is much harder to define
as a useable statistical or financial variable. <a
