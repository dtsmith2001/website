<p>These are all quotes from Thomas Wolfe's first book, <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>.

<ul>

<li>This is the preface:</i><br>

<p>...a stone, a leaf, an unfound door; of a stone, a leaf, a door. And of all the forgotten
faces.<br><br>

Naked and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did not know our mother’s face; from the
prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this
earth.<br><br>

Whick of us has known his brother? Which of us has looked into his father’s heart? Which of us has
not remained forever prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?<br><br>

O waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost among bright stars on this most weary unbright cinder, lost!
Remembering speachlessly we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a
stone, a leaf, an unfound door. Where? When?<br><br>

O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.</p>

<li>A quote from p. 74:<br>

<p>... the hour after his birth she had looked in his dark eyes and had seen something that would
brood there eternally, she knew, unfathomable wells of remote and intangible loneliness: she knew
that in her dark and sorrowful womb a stranger had come to life, fed by the lost communications of
eternity, his own ghost, haunter of his own house, lonely to himself and to the world. O lost.</p>

<li>Here's a quote from p. 204:<br>

<p>His faith was above conviction. Disillusionment had come so often that it had awakened within him
a strain of bitter suspicion, an occasional mockery, virulent, coarse, cruel, and subtle, which was
all the more scalding because of his own pain. Unknowlingly, he had begun to build up in himself a
vast mythology for which he cared all the more deeply because he realized its untruth. Brokenly,
obscurely, he wasbeginning to feel that it was not truth that men live for-the creative men-but for
falsehood. At times his devouring, unsated brain seemed to be beyond his governance: it was a
frightful bird whose beak was in his heart, whose talons tore unceasingly at his bowels. And this
unsleeping demon wheeled, plunged, revolved about an object, returning suddently, after it had flown
away, with victorious malice, leaving stripped, mean, and common all that he had clothed with
wonder.<br><br>

O lost, and by the wind grieved ghost, come back again!</p>

<li>This is from p. 382:<br>

<p>"...I am thy father's spirit,<br> Doomed for a certain term to walk the night<br> Between
Bloomington and Portland, Maine."<br><br>

O God! O God! We have been an exile in another land and a stranger in our own. The mountains were our
masters: they went home to our eye and our heart before we came to five. Whatever we can do or say
must be forever hillbound .Our senses have been fed by our terrific land; our blood has learned to
run to the imperial pulse of America which, leaving, we can never loose and never forget. We walked
along a road in Cumberland, and stooped, because the sky hung down so low; and when we ran away from
London, we went by little rivers in a land just big enough. And nowhere that we went was far: the
earth and sky were close and near. And the old hunger returned-the terrible and obscure hunger that
haunts and hurts Americans, and that makes us exiles at home and strangers wherever we go.</p>
