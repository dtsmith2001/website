<p>I compiled this list from posts to comp.stat.math, email responses to
my post, and MathSciDoc (a product of the American Mathematical Society,
courtesy of the <a href="http://www.gatech.lib.edu">Georgia Institute of
Technology Library</a>).</p>

<p>Prof. John Aitchison at the University of Glasgow faxed me the
following references on the subject. His original paper on the subject
is</p>

<p>J. Aitchison and S. D. Silvey, "Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of
Parameters Subject to Restraints", Vol. 29, 1958, Annals of Mathematical
Statistics, p. 813-828.</p>

<p>Following up on the ideas they discovered, the pair published
several other interesting papers:</p>

<p>S. D. Silvey, "The Lagrange-Multiplier Test", Vol. 30, 1959, Annals of
Mathematical Statistics, p. 389-407.</p>

<p>J. Aitchison and S. D. Silvey, "Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
Procedures and Associated Tests of Significance", Vol. B22, 1960, Journal
of the Royal Statistical Society, p. 154-171.</p>

<p>J. Aitchison, "Large Sample Restrictive Parametric Tests", Vol. B23,
Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, p. 367-392.</p>

<p>J. Aitchison, "Confidence Region Tests", Vol. B23, 1962, Journal of
the Royal Statistical Society, p. 161-175.</p>

<p>J. Aitchison, "Likelihood-ratio Tests and Confidence Region Tests",
Vol. B27, 1965, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, </p>

<p>As someone posted in the newsgroup, there is a problem when the
estimators are on the boundary of the parameter set (the set defined by
the constraints). Professor Aitchison conjectured that the distribution
of the test statistics under the unll hypothesis is a mixture of
chi-squareds. He suggests the following reference:</p>

<p>H. Chernoff, "The Distribution of the Likelihood Ratio", Vol. 25,
1954, Annals of Mathematical Statistics, p. 573-578.

<p>This in fact turns out to be true, see below for some more recent
information.</p>

<p>Ron Schoenberg supplied me with the following references:</p>

<p>Pierce and Rust, "Constrained Least Squares Interval Estimation", SIAM
J. Sci. Stat Comput. 6:670-683.</p>

<p>Self, "Asymptotic Properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimators and
Likelihood Ratio Tests Under Nonstandard Conditions", JASA,
82:605-610.</p>

<p>R. Modarres and J. P. Nolan, "A Method for Simulating Stable Random
Vectors", Computational Statistics, 9:11-19.</p>

<p>Kudo, Akio, "A Multivariate Analogue of the One-Sided Test",
Biometrika, Vol 50, 1963, p. 403-418.

<p>Frank Wolak, "The Local Nature of Hypothesis Tests Involving
Inequality Constraints in Nonlinear Models", Econometrica, 59:
981-995.</p>

and Kuhn-Tucker Test in Linear Models with Inequality Constraints on the
Regression Parameters", 50:63-80.</p>

<p>The following was posted or sent to me by Charles Geyer.</p>

of Statistics, Vol. 22, 1994, p. 1993-2010.</p>
